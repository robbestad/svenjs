# SvenJS

A (mostly) pure functional reactive web framework

# Goals

 - Time travel

 	- Every component has time travel abilities built in by default.

 - Enforced state immutability
 	
 	- With time travel abilities comes immutability

 - Built in store implementation

 	- With actions and emitter

 - Synthetic event handler. Implemented in such a way that input events work across browsers.
 
 - Focus on developer experience; keeping the programmer happy

 - Minimal file size

 	- The minified version is about 4.5K. Compressing can reduce the file size even more.
